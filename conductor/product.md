# Initial Concept

The user wants to implement multi-timer support in Super Productivity. Currently, only one timer is visible and active in the top bar. The goal is to allow multiple timers to run simultaneously, with all active timers being visible and manageable within the "Today" view, preferably as prominent elements at the top of the list.

# Product Definition - Super Productivity (Multi-Timer Edition)

## Vision

Super Productivity aims to be the ultimate, privacy-focused tool for professional productivity. By integrating with major task management platforms and providing robust local time tracking, it empowers users to manage their work without the overhead of context switching. The next evolution focuses on advanced time management, specifically allowing users to track multiple concurrent work streams, and paving the way for AI-assisted productivity.

## Core Goals

- **Multi-Timer Support:** Enable users to run multiple timers simultaneously to reflect complex, overlapping workflows.
- **Enhanced Today View:** Make all active timers prominent and easily manageable within the daily task list.
